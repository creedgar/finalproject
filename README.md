Faucets and Fountain is a webpage used to help users access amenities around Yale's campus.

Once you load the website, you will be taken to our interative map page, where you can click on an area to access that areas. Once you've accessed a specific area on campus, the buildings in that area will be displayed in click-able tiles. You can click to access a specific building within that area. The building will be displayed in a parallax scrolling display, and you can click buttons to see the building's amenities: vending machines, restrooms, or fountains. Once you've selected an amenity type, you will be shown a list of the amenities in the building of that type. This page will show data from our database about each amenity, such as the average rating and gender, type(food or drink), or if it has a bottle refiller. If there are no amenities in our database at the time that match the type and building you've selected, you will be shown a "Coming Soon" message, with navigation buttons, and a button leading to a page where you can submit new amenities that you're aware of.

On all pages, you will be able to navigate to the home (map) page and to the search page. With our filtered search row on the search page, you can input certain data (type, floor, gender if bathroom, building, room name, type of contents if vending machine, fountain refiller or not if fountain, and average rating in its reviews.) about an amenity to filter the search list. On the search page, all amenities will be listed and you will be able to navigate to each amenity's individual amenity page. On the amenity page, all of the database information we have for the amenity will be listed, and all of the existing reviews for this amenity will be displayed. The amenity page will have a navigation link to review an amenity, where you will have to select what amenity you are reviewing, then you can input your review and a rating out of 5. 

To submit an amenity or to leave a review, you must be logged in. If you are not logged in when you navigate to the submit or review pages, you will be redirected to the register page. When registering, you cannot use a username that is already taken, and your password must match the confirmation when you register. If your password and username do not match our criteria, an apology webpage (Ã  la finance) will be returned with an image of a toilet and text explaining your issue. Once you are registered, you will be directed back to the home (map) page. You must re-navigate to the submit or review pages to submit a new amenity or write a review. 

Our information is all self observed and verified. In the implementation of this project, we plan to act as admin and verify all amenities that users upload, and to manually delete duplicates.
